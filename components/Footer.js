              runner&#44; the basketball player&#44; the soccer kid&#44; the
              fitness enthusiast. The weekend hiker that loves to escape the
              city. The yoga teacher that spreads the moves. The 3-Stripes are
              seen in the music scene. On stage&#44; at festivals. Our sports
              clothing keeps you focused before that whistle blows. During the

              adidas designs for and with athletes of all kinds. Creators&#44;
              who love to change the game. Challenge conventions. Break the
              rules and define new ones. Then break them again. We supply teams
              and individuals with athletic clothing pre-match. To stay
              focussed. We design sports apparel that get you to the finish
              line. To win the match. We support women&#44; with bras and tights
              made for purpose. From low to high support. Maximum comfort. We
              design&#44; innovate and itterate. Testing new technologies in
              action. On the pitch&#44; the tracks&#44; the court&#44; the pool.
              Like Stan Smith. And Superstar. Now seen on the streets and the
              stages.

              Through our collections we blur the borders between high fashion
              and high performance. Like our adidas by Stella McCartney athletic
              clothing collection designed to look the part inside and outside
              of the gym. Or some of our adidas Originals lifestyle pieces&#44;
              that can be worn as sportswear too. Our lives are constantly
              changing. Becoming more and more versatile. And adidas designs
              with that in mind.
